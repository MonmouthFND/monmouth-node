Block dissemination handler using commonware's [`Marshaled`][marshaled] application adapter.

## Overview

The [`Marshaled`][marshaled] adapter handles epoch transitions and validates block ancestry.
This adapter "wraps" the application to handle the following ancestry checks automatically
during verification:

- **Block Ancestry**: Parent Commitment matches the consensus context's expected parent.
- **Epoch Transitions**: Block height is exactly one greater than the parent's height.

## Key Types

- `Marshal` - Core block dissemination handler
- `MarshalConfig` - Configuration for marshal behavior
