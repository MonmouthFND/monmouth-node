Consensus reporters for Monmouth nodes.

This crate provides reusable `commonware_consensus::Reporter` implementations used by
Monmouth node applications.

## Key Types

- `SeedReporter` - captures simplex activity seeds and hashes them for later proposals
- `FinalizedReporter` - replays finalized blocks, validates roots, and persists snapshots
- `NodeStateReporter` - updates RPC-visible node state (view, finalized count, nullified count) from consensus activity
- `BlockContextProvider` - trait for providing block execution context

These reporters are designed to work with `monmouth-ledger` and can be used in both the
example REVM chain and production nodes.

## Usage

```rust,ignore
use monmouth_reporters::{SeedReporter, FinalizedReporter, NodeStateReporter};

// Create reporters for consensus integration
let seed_reporter = SeedReporter::new(ledger_service.clone());
let finalized_reporter = FinalizedReporter::new(
    ledger_service.clone(),
    context,
    executor,
    provider,
);
let node_state_reporter = NodeStateReporter::new(node_state);
```
